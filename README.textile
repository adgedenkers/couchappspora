h1. CouchAppspora

h3. ..is Diaspora implemented on CouchDB

p. The Diaspora source code was initially "released":http://www.joindiaspora.com/2010/09/15/developer-release.html on September 15th, 2010. This project is an implementation of the Diaspora protocol as a CouchApp built entirely on CouchDB.

h3. Why?

p. CouchDB is a good fit for a federated social web node due to it's robust replication and MVCC implementations. Diaspora is an attractive implementation of a federated social web application. I want to marry the front end and features of Diaspora, but build them on the flexible replication of CouchDB.

h3. Hosting your own

p. To demonstrate the built in replication that you get with CouchDB (I haven't implemented any federated web protocols quite yet):

* Go to "couchone.com/get":http://couchone.com/get and sign up for a Couch
* Make a database and set up continuous replication from @http://glitterbacon.couchone.com/couchappspora@ to your new database
* Visit "http://yourcouch/yourdb/_design/couchappspora/index.html":http://yourcouch/yourdb/_design/couchappspora/index.html
